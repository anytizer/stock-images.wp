== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I put my photos in multiple directories? =

Yes. Just update your file name after your base url.
eg. `[stockimage name='sub-directory/image-name.jpg']`


= Are my photos safe? =

Actual hosting of your photography is not the scope of this plugin.
You can upload your photos anywhere accessible via web.
Protect hotlinking on your photos and disable directory listing for safety.
